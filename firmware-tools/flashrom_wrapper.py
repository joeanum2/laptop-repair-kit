"""
Wrapper for the `flashrom` utility to simplify BIOS and EC flashing.

This script checks for the presence of `flashrom` on your PATH and
then forwards all additional commandâ€‘line arguments to it using the
CH341A programmer by default. For example, to read a SPI chip into
`dump.bin` use:

    python flashrom_wrapper.py -r dump.bin

To write an image called `new.bin`:

    python flashrom_wrapper.py -w new.bin

Please ensure you have backed up the existing firmware before writing.
